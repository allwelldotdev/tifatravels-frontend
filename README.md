# Travel, Tourism, and Travel-Related E-Commerce Website Design for NG Client
This repo contains code files for a subsidiary of companies I worked for, owned and run by a Nigerian (NG) client.

Each folder in this repo represents each of the companies owned and run by Nigerian client.

### Tifa Travels & Tours (Tourism Board Website)

Tifa Travels & Tours ([tifatravels.com](https://tifatravels.com)) is the parent company that houses all other companies. I did projects across all companies.

Tifa Travels & Tours, as the name implies, is a travel and tourism company. Actually, one of the top 25 travel management companies in Nigeriaâ€”managing major businesses and corporations in Nigeria.

I built and maintained the company's tourism board website - [tours.tifatravels.com](https://tours.tifatravels.com) on WordPress. Custom built with PHP and CSS.
